# Ring:bit Car Package
This ELECFREAKS Ring:bit Car package was developed by [ELECFREAKS](https://www.elecfreaks.com/) with minor assistance from [Tinkercademy](https://tinkercademy.com/).

The ELECFREAKS Ring:bit Car is a small DIY smart car driven by the BBC micro:bit and the ELECFREAKS Ring:bit. The Ring:bit extends the micro:bit's 3 GPIO ports and allow for different sensors and components to be easily attached to the micro:bit. A basic Ring:bit Car can be easily programmed to run autonomously, with a remote control, and even create rainbow beacons of light. Just add one of the many extensions available and your Ring:bit Car can do even more things like line and light following, obstacle avoiding, drawing and more!
